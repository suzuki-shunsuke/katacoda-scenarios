Let's create a configuration file `aqua.yaml` by `aqua init` command.

Let's move to the working directory and check `aqua.yaml`.

`cd /workspace`{{execute}}

`ls aqua.yaml`{{execute}}

Then run `aqua init`{{execute}} and check `aqua.yaml` again.

`cat aqua.yaml`{{execute}}

`packages` is still empty, so no tool is installed.
